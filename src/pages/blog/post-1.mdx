# Hi there!

## {customProp}

This Markdown file creates a page at `your-domain.com/page-1/`

It probably isn't styled much, but Markdown does support:

- **bold** and _italics._
- lists
- [links](https://astro.build)
- and more!

```astro
---
import BaseLayout from "../layouts/BaseLayout.astro";
---

<BaseLayout title="Home">
  <h1>Homepage</h1>
</BaseLayout>
```
